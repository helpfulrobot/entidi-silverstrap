The default implementation provides support for custom nested levels
in .navlist but does not provide a way to access the parent nodes (as
usually done in vanilla SilverStripe). To achieve this you must override
NavbarItem.ss and add a fixed item at the beginning of the <ul>, right
before looping on $Children:

<li class="$LinkingMode">
    <a href="$Link.ATT" title="<%t Silverstrap.GOTO page=$Title.ATT %>">$Title</a>
</li>
